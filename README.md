<h1 align="center">ECON333 Exam 2 Revision UI @ UIC</h1>

## How to use
Basically I have attatched all of the materials I used to form the UI so don't open them if you want to. The real deal is downloading econ.html onto your computer and running it locally. I always hated having to lose internet connection mid-way through learning so that's the reason behind that lol.

## Contributing
I really appreciate it if you want to contribute to this project. I can recommend the GitHub issues marked as "Good First Issue" to get started. I'm still trying to build out an accurate question/answer database


## Notice
This project is not associated with the school, UIC, in any way. I just enjoy coding and thought that there's no free UI thats similar that could help me test my knowledge for free.
