  { question: '1. What is the difference between the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate?', answer: 'The spot exchange rate is the current exchange rate, while the forward exchange rate is the exchange rate at a future date.' },
  { question: '2. What is the relationship between the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate, and the forward exchange rate according to covered interest parity?', answer: 'According to covered interest parity, the forward exchange rate is determined by the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate, and the spot exchange rate: F_$/€ = E_$/€ * (1+i_$) / (1+i_€)' },
  { question: '3. How does an increase in the domestic interest rate affect the exchange rate according to the uncovered interest parity (UIP) relationship?', answer: 'According to UIP, if the domestic interest rate increases relative to the foreign interest rate, the domestic currency is expected to depreciate against the foreign currency.' },
  
  // Additional Questions from Second Document
  { question: '4. What is the relationship between the inflation differential and exchange rate depreciation according to relative purchasing power parity (PPP)?', answer: 'According to relative PPP, the exchange rate depreciates at a rate equal to the inflation differential between the domestic and foreign countries: %ΔE_$/€ = πUS - πEUR' },
  { question: '5. How does the quantity theory of money explain the long-run behavior of exchange rates?', answer: 'The quantity theory of money states that in the long run, exchange rate depreciation is equal to the difference between domestic and foreign money growth rates, minus the difference in their output growth rates: %ΔE_$/€ = (μUS - μEUR) - (gUS - gEUR)' },
  { question: '6. What are the advantages of a fixed exchange rate regime?', answer: 'Under a fixed exchange rate regime, the country fixing its exchange rate will have the same long-run inflation rate as the currency it is pegged to. This provides monetary policy discipline and helps stabilize inflation expectations.' },
  { question: '7. How does a fixed exchange rate regime constrain a country\'s monetary policy?', answer: 'With a fixed exchange rate, the money supply growth rate of the pegging country must equal the money supply growth rate of the currency it is pegged to, minus the difference in their output growth rates: μFGN = μUS - (gUS - gFGN)' },
  { question: '8. What are the main types of nominal anchors used in exchange rate and monetary policy frameworks?', answer: 'The main types of nominal anchors are: 1) Exchange rate target, 2) Money supply target, 3) Inflation target, and 4) Nominal interest rate target.' },
  
  // PPP-Related Questions from Third Document (PPP)
  { question: '9. What is the Law of One Price (LOOP)?', answer: 'LOOP states that goods cost the same, when expressed in the same currency, everywhere in the world. It is based on the idea that arbitrage will equalize prices across different countries.' },
  { question: '10. What is Absolute Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)?', answer: 'Absolute PPP states that the general price level, when expressed in the same currency, is the same everywhere in the world: P_US = E_$/€ * P_EUR' },
  { question: '11. What is the formula for calculating the nominal exchange rate according to PPP?', answer: 'E_$/€ = P_US / P_EUR, where E_$/€ is the exchange rate, P_US is the U.S. price, and P_EUR is the European price.' },
  { question: '12. Explain Relative Purchasing Power Parity (Relative PPP)', answer: 'Relative PPP assumes that the relative price differences between countries remain constant over time. The percentage change in exchange rate equals the inflation differential: %∆ E_$/€ = π_US - π_EUR' },
  { question: '13. How does inflation relate to exchange rates according to Relative PPP?', answer: 'According to Relative PPP, the percentage change in exchange rate is equal to the difference in inflation rates between two countries: %∆ E_$/€ = π_US - π_EUR' },
  { question: '14. What is the Real Exchange Rate?', answer: 'The real exchange rate (q) is the ratio of the cost of a basket of goods in the foreign country to the cost in the home country, when expressed in a common currency: q_US/EUR = P_EUR * E_$/€ / P_US' },
      // New additional questions from PPP
      { question: '15. If a hotel room costs $100 in the U.S. and €80 in Paris, what is the exchange rate according to PPP?', answer: 'The exchange rate is $1.25 per euro (100/80 = 1.25)' },
      { question: '16. What happens to the exchange rate if U.S. inflation is 10% and European inflation is 2%?', answer: 'The exchange rate will depreciate by approximately 8% (10% - 2%), according to Relative PPP' },
      { question: '17. How does an increase in the real exchange rate affect net exports?', answer: 'An increase in the real exchange rate leads to increased net exports, as foreign goods become relatively cheaper and domestic goods become more competitive' },
      { question: '18. How does the quantity theory of money relate to exchange rates?', answer: 'The quantity theory helps determine the price level, which directly impacts the exchange rate through the PPP relationship: E_$/€ = (M_US L_EUR Y_EUR) / (M_EUR L_US Y_US)' },
      { question: '19. What are three reasons why PPP might not hold in the short run?', answer: 'Reasons include: 1) Transaction costs, 2) Nontraded goods, 3) Imperfect competition and price discrimination' },
      { question: '20. If a product costs $3 currently and experiences 2% inflation, what will its price be next year?', answer: '$3 * 1.02 = $3.06' },
      { question: '21. Explain the difference between Absolute PPP and Relative PPP', answer: 'Absolute PPP predicts the level of exchange rate based on price levels, while Relative PPP predicts changes in exchange rate based on inflation differentials' },

  // Additional Questions from Second Document (Continued)
  { question: '43. How does an increase in the domestic interest rate affect the exchange rate according to the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition?', answer: 'According to UIP, if the domestic interest rate increases relative to the foreign interest rate, the domestic currency is expected to depreciate against the foreign currency: %ΔEe_$/€ = i$ - i€' },
  { question: '44. What is the relationship between the forward exchange rate and the expected future spot exchange rate according to uncovered interest parity (UIP)?', answer: 'UIP states that the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future expected spot exchange rate: Ee_$/€ = F_$/€' },
  { question: '45. How can arbitrage be used to exploit differences between the forward exchange rate and the expected future spot exchange rate?', answer: 'If the forward rate F_$/€ is less than the expected future spot rate Ee_$/€, an investor can buy euros in the forward market and sell them in the spot market in the future for a profit. This arbitrage will drive the forward rate up to equal the expected future spot rate.' },
  { question: '46. What is the \'cross-rate\' between currencies, and how is it calculated?', answer: 'The cross-rate between two currencies is the implied exchange rate calculated from the exchange rates of those currencies against a third \'vehicle\' currency. The cross-rate E_€/£ is calculated as E_$/£ / E_$/€.' },
  { question: '47. How are all exchange rates linked through the cross-rate relationship?', answer: 'The cross-rate equation shows that all exchange rates are interconnected. If you know the exchange rate of the dollar against all other currencies, you can calculate the exchange rate between any two other currencies using the cross-rate formula.' },
  { question: '48. What is \'triangular arbitrage\' and how can it be used to profit from mispriced exchange rates?', answer: 'Triangular arbitrage involves converting one currency into a second currency via a third \'vehicle\' currency, when the indirect exchange rate (e.g. $/€ * €/£) is more favorable than the direct exchange rate ($/£). This allows the trader to profit from the mispricing.' },
  { question: '49. How does an increase in a country\'s relative price level (compared to foreign prices) affect the demand for its currency?', answer: 'An increase in the domestic price level relative to foreign prices makes domestic goods less attractive, shifting the demand for the domestic currency to the left and causing the currency to depreciate.' },
  { question: '50. What is the effect of an increase in a country\'s GDP on the demand for its currency?', answer: 'An increase in domestic GDP leads to greater overall consumption, including more imports. This shifts the demand for foreign currency to the right, causing the domestic currency to appreciate.' },
  { question: '51. How do changes in political risk and business profitability in a country affect the supply and demand for its currency?', answer: 'Decreased political risk or more favorable business conditions in a country will increase foreign investment inflows, shifting the supply of the domestic currency to the right and causing the currency to appreciate.' },
  { question: '52. What is the role of central banks in the foreign exchange market, and how do their interventions affect exchange rates?', answer: 'Central banks can intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling their domestic currency. This shifts the supply or demand curves and affects the exchange rate. Central bank interventions are a form of managed floating exchange rate regime.' },
{ question: '53. How do expectations about future exchange rates impact current foreign currency demand?', answer: 'If the price of foreign currency is expected to increase in the future, the current demand for foreign currency will increase today, as investors seek to benefit from anticipated appreciation.' },
{ question: '54. What is the role of arbitrage in maintaining exchange rate equilibrium?', answer: 'Arbitrage ensures that currency markets remain efficient by exploiting price differences. When forward rates or expected spot rates differ, investors will trade to eliminate profitable opportunities, driving rates back to equilibrium.' },
{ question: '55. How does innovation in a country affect its currency demand?', answer: 'Successful innovation and marketing of new products can increase foreign demand for a countrys goods, shifting the supply of foreign currency rightwards and potentially causing currency appreciation.' },
{ question: '56. What macroeconomic factors influence long-run exchange rates according to the Quantity Theory of Money?', answer: 'Long-run exchange rates are influenced by differences in money supply growth rates and output growth rates between countries: %ΔE_$/€ = (μUS - μEUR) - (gUS - gEUR)' },
{ question: '57. How do tariffs and trade restrictions impact foreign currency markets?', answer: 'Trade restrictions can reduce demand for foreign goods, shifting the demand or supply curves for foreign currency. U.S. tariffs on foreign products will decrease the demand for foreign currency, while foreign tariffs on U.S. products will decrease the supply of foreign currency.' },
{ question: '58. What is the significance of interest rate differentials in foreign exchange markets?', answer: 'Interest rate differentials drive capital flows and impact exchange rates. A higher domestic interest rate relative to foreign rates will attract foreign investment, influencing currency demand and exchange rate expectations.' },
{ question: '59. How do political risks affect foreign currency markets?', answer: 'Political instability can decrease investment attractiveness, shifting both supply and demand curves. Decreased political risk in a country will increase foreign investment, causing currency appreciation.' },
{ question: '60. What is the connection between business profitability and currency valuation?', answer: 'Countries with favorable business climates (low taxes, low corruption) attract more foreign and domestic investment. This shifts both supply and demand curves, potentially leading to currency appreciation.' },
{ question: '61. How does output growth impact inflation and exchange rates in the long run?', answer: 'According to the Quantity Theory of Money, output growth affects inflation: π = μ - g. Lower output growth with constant money supply growth leads to higher inflation, which impacts exchange rates through Relative PPP.' },
{ question: '62. What are the implications of a fixed exchange rate regime for monetary policy?', answer: 'Fixed exchange rates constrain monetary policy, forcing the pegging country to match the money supply growth of the reference currency. This provides a nominal anchor and helps stabilize inflation expectations.' },
{ question: '63. How do changes in GDP impact foreign currency demand?', answer: 'An increase in domestic GDP leads to higher consumption, including more imports. This shifts the demand curve for foreign currency rightwards, potentially causing domestic currency depreciation.' },
{ question: '64. What mechanisms prevent persistent arbitrage opportunities in foreign exchange markets?', answer: 'Arbitrage quickly eliminates price discrepancies as investors exploit differences in forward rates, expected spot rates, and interest rates, driving these rates back to equilibrium.' },
{ question: '65. How do consumer tastes for foreign goods influence exchange rates?', answer: 'Changes in consumer preferences for foreign goods can shift the demand curve for foreign currency. Increased demand for foreign products will increase the demand for foreign currency, potentially affecting exchange rates.' },
{ question: '66. What is the role of transaction costs in preventing perfect PPP?', answer: 'Transaction costs, including transportation, tariffs, and market frictions, prevent the perfect equalization of prices across countries, which is why Purchasing Power Parity might not hold exactly in the short run.' },
{ question: '67. How do nontraded goods impact the validity of Purchasing Power Parity?', answer: 'Nontraded goods, such as local services, have prices determined domestically and cannot be easily arbitraged internationally, which prevents perfect price equalization and challenges PPP in the short run.' },
{ question: '68. What is the impact of imperfect competition on exchange rates?', answer: 'Imperfect competition and price discrimination allow firms to set different prices in different markets, which prevents the perfect price equalization assumed by Purchasing Power Parity.' },
{ question: '69. How do vehicle currencies facilitate international exchange?', answer: 'Vehicle currencies like the U.S. dollar are used to facilitate exchanges between lesser-used currencies, reducing transaction costs and providing liquidity in foreign exchange markets.' },
{ question: '70. What is the significance of cross rates in foreign exchange markets?', answer: 'Cross rates allow calculation of exchange rates between non-USD currencies by using their USD exchange rates, demonstrating the interconnectedness of global currency markets.' },
{ question: '71. How do central banks manage exchange rates in a floating regime?', answer: 'In a managed floating exchange rate regime, central banks can intervene by buying or selling domestic currency to influence exchange rates, providing a degree of stability without fully fixing the rate.' },
{ question: '72. What are the long-term implications of persistent high inflation differentials?', answer: 'Persistent high inflation differentials lead to continuous exchange rate depreciation for the high-inflation country, potentially causing economic instability and reduced international competitiveness.' },
{ question: '73. What are the two guiding principles of the WTO?', answer:'Multilateralism and nondiscrimination'},
{ question: '74. If a free trade agreement increases trade with one country but decreases trade with all others by the same amount, is it economically beneficial?', answer:'No, it is harmful. The agreement is only beneficial if it increases overall trade (trade creation) rather than just shifting trade between countries.'},
{ question: '75. What is triangular arbitrage?', answer:'A trading strategy that exploits price differences in exchange rates across different markets. For example, if the direct and indirect costs of converting between currencies differ, traders can make a profit by executing a series of currency exchanges.'},
{ question: '76. What are some reasons why Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) might not hold in the short run?', answer:'Possible reasons include Nontraded goods, transportation costs and trade barriers, imperfect competition and legal obstacles, price stickiness, excise taxes.'},
{ question: '77. What generates a supply or demand for a foreign currency?', answer:'Supply of currency = When a country buys goods/services from another country. Demand for currency = When a country sells goods/services to another country'},
{ question: '78. Describe the S&D for Currency_Br if he Brazilian central bank significantly lowers its interest rates.', answer:'Supply of Reals shifts rightwards. Lower interest rates will prevent investors from keeping money in Brazillian currency and will seek for better currencies, raising the S. Similarly the D for Brazillian Reals will fall and shift Left.'},
{ question: '79. Describe the S&D for Mexican Pesos if a major technology company announces it will open a large manufacturing plant in Mexico.', answer:'Demand for Mexican Pesos will shift right. This is because more investors would want to invest in the company, and the only way to do that is in Mexican Pesos.'},
{ question: '80. Describe the S&D for Currency_ Arg if the political instability breaks out in Argentina, causing significant economic uncertainty.', answer:'Demand will shift left because investors will pull their money out of the country, investing in more stable markets.'},
{ question: '81. The S&D of US Dollars if the United States experiences a sharp increase in inflation.', answer:'High inflation reduces the purchasing power of the dollar, thus, investors will pull out from investing in the currency and shifting the demand curve left'}
