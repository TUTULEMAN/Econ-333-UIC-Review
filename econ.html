  // Original Flashcards
  { question: 'What is the difference between the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate?', answer: 'The spot exchange rate is the current exchange rate, while the forward exchange rate is the exchange rate at a future date.' },
  { question: 'What is the relationship between the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate, and the forward exchange rate according to covered interest parity?', answer: 'According to covered interest parity, the forward exchange rate is determined by the domestic interest rate, the foreign interest rate, and the spot exchange rate: F_$/€ = E_$/€ * (1+i_$) / (1+i_€)' },
  { question: 'How does an increase in the domestic interest rate affect the exchange rate according to the uncovered interest parity (UIP) relationship?', answer: 'According to UIP, if the domestic interest rate increases relative to the foreign interest rate, the domestic currency is expected to depreciate against the foreign currency.' },
  
  // Additional Questions from Second Document
  { question: 'What is the relationship between the inflation differential and exchange rate depreciation according to relative purchasing power parity (PPP)?', answer: 'According to relative PPP, the exchange rate depreciates at a rate equal to the inflation differential between the domestic and foreign countries: %ΔE_$/€ = πUS - πEUR' },
  { question: 'How does the quantity theory of money explain the long-run behavior of exchange rates?', answer: 'The quantity theory of money states that in the long run, exchange rate depreciation is equal to the difference between domestic and foreign money growth rates, minus the difference in their output growth rates: %ΔE_$/€ = (μUS - μEUR) - (gUS - gEUR)' },
  { question: 'What are the advantages of a fixed exchange rate regime?', answer: 'Under a fixed exchange rate regime, the country fixing its exchange rate will have the same long-run inflation rate as the currency it is pegged to. This provides monetary policy discipline and helps stabilize inflation expectations.' },
  { question: 'How does a fixed exchange rate regime constrain a country\'s monetary policy?', answer: 'With a fixed exchange rate, the money supply growth rate of the pegging country must equal the money supply growth rate of the currency it is pegged to, minus the difference in their output growth rates: μFGN = μUS - (gUS - gFGN)' },
  { question: 'What are the main types of nominal anchors used in exchange rate and monetary policy frameworks?', answer: 'The main types of nominal anchors are: 1) Exchange rate target, 2) Money supply target, 3) Inflation target, and 4) Nominal interest rate target.' },
  
  // PPP-Related Questions from Third Document (PPP)
  { question: 'What is the Law of One Price (LOOP)?', answer: 'LOOP states that goods cost the same, when expressed in the same currency, everywhere in the world. It is based on the idea that arbitrage will equalize prices across different countries.' },
  { question: 'What is Absolute Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)?', answer: 'Absolute PPP states that the general price level, when expressed in the same currency, is the same everywhere in the world: P_US = E_$/€ * P_EUR' },
  { question: 'What is the formula for calculating the nominal exchange rate according to PPP?', answer: 'E_$/€ = P_US / P_EUR, where E_$/€ is the exchange rate, P_US is the U.S. price, and P_EUR is the European price.' },
  { question: 'Explain Relative Purchasing Power Parity (Relative PPP)', answer: 'Relative PPP assumes that the relative price differences between countries remain constant over time. The percentage change in exchange rate equals the inflation differential: %∆ E_$/€ = π_US - π_EUR' },
  { question: 'How does inflation relate to exchange rates according to Relative PPP?', answer: 'According to Relative PPP, the percentage change in exchange rate is equal to the difference in inflation rates between two countries: %∆ E_$/€ = π_US - π_EUR' },
  { question: 'What is the Real Exchange Rate?', answer: 'The real exchange rate (q) is the ratio of the cost of a basket of goods in the foreign country to the cost in the home country, when expressed in a common currency: q_US/EUR = P_EUR * E_$/€ / P_US' },
      // New additional questions from PPP
      { question: 'If a hotel room costs $100 in the U.S. and €80 in Paris, what is the exchange rate according to PPP?', answer: 'The exchange rate is $1.25 per euro (100/80 = 1.25)' },
      { question: 'What happens to the exchange rate if U.S. inflation is 10% and European inflation is 2%?', answer: 'The exchange rate will depreciate by approximately 8% (10% - 2%), according to Relative PPP' },
      { question: 'How does an increase in the real exchange rate affect net exports?', answer: 'An increase in the real exchange rate leads to increased net exports, as foreign goods become relatively cheaper and domestic goods become more competitive' },
      { question: 'How does the quantity theory of money relate to exchange rates?', answer: 'The quantity theory helps determine the price level, which directly impacts the exchange rate through the PPP relationship: E_$/€ = (M_US L_EUR Y_EUR) / (M_EUR L_US Y_US)' },
      { question: 'What are three reasons why PPP might not hold in the short run?', answer: 'Reasons include: 1) Transaction costs, 2) Nontraded goods, 3) Imperfect competition and price discrimination' },
      { question: 'If a product costs $3 currently and experiences 2% inflation, what will its price be next year?', answer: '$3 * 1.02 = $3.06' },
      { question: 'Explain the difference between Absolute PPP and Relative PPP', answer: 'Absolute PPP predicts the level of exchange rate based on price levels, while Relative PPP predicts changes in exchange rate based on inflation differentials' },

  // Additional Questions from Second Document (Continued)
	{ question: 'What is the exchange rate?', answer: 'The exchange rate is the relative price of two currencies, expressed as the amount of one currency needed to purchase a unit of another.'},

  // Additional Questions from Second Document (Continued)
  { question: 'How does an increase in the domestic interest rate affect the exchange rate according to the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition?', answer: 'According to UIP, if the domestic interest rate increases relative to the foreign interest rate, the domestic currency is expected to depreciate against the foreign currency: %ΔEe_$/€ = i$ - i€' },
  { question: 'What is the relationship between the forward exchange rate and the expected future spot exchange rate according to uncovered interest parity (UIP)?', answer: 'UIP states that the forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of the future expected spot exchange rate: Ee_$/€ = F_$/€' },
  { question: 'How can arbitrage be used to exploit differences between the forward exchange rate and the expected future spot exchange rate?', answer: 'If the forward rate F_$/€ is less than the expected future spot rate Ee_$/€, an investor can buy euros in the forward market and sell them in the spot market in the future for a profit. This arbitrage will drive the forward rate up to equal the expected future spot rate.' },
  { question: 'What is the \'cross-rate\' between currencies, and how is it calculated?', answer: 'The cross-rate between two currencies is the implied exchange rate calculated from the exchange rates of those currencies against a third \'vehicle\' currency. The cross-rate E_€/£ is calculated as E_$/£ / E_$/€.' },
  { question: 'How are all exchange rates linked through the cross-rate relationship?', answer: 'The cross-rate equation shows that all exchange rates are interconnected. If you know the exchange rate of the dollar against all other currencies, you can calculate the exchange rate between any two other currencies using the cross-rate formula.' },
  { question: 'What is \'triangular arbitrage\' and how can it be used to profit from mispriced exchange rates?', answer: 'Triangular arbitrage involves converting one currency into a second currency via a third \'vehicle\' currency, when the indirect exchange rate (e.g. $/€ * €/£) is more favorable than the direct exchange rate ($/£). This allows the trader to profit from the mispricing.' },
  { question: 'How does an increase in a country\'s relative price level (compared to foreign prices) affect the demand for its currency?', answer: 'An increase in the domestic price level relative to foreign prices makes domestic goods less attractive, shifting the demand for the domestic currency to the left and causing the currency to depreciate.' },
  { question: 'What is the effect of an increase in a country\'s GDP on the demand for its currency?', answer: 'An increase in domestic GDP leads to greater overall consumption, including more imports. This shifts the demand for foreign currency to the right, causing the domestic currency to appreciate.' },
  { question: 'How do changes in political risk and business profitability in a country affect the supply and demand for its currency?', answer: 'Decreased political risk or more favorable business conditions in a country will increase foreign investment inflows, shifting the supply of the domestic currency to the right and causing the currency to appreciate.' },
  { question: 'What is the role of central banks in the foreign exchange market, and how do their interventions affect exchange rates?', answer: 'Central banks can intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling their domestic currency. This shifts the supply or demand curves and affects the exchange rate. Central bank interventions are a form of managed floating exchange rate regime.' }
